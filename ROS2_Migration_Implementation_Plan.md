# ROS2 Migration Implementation Plan

This document provides a step-by-step plan for migrating the Enhanced_ReKep4xarm_Tinker project to ROS2 on Ubuntu 22.04.

---

## Testing Along the Way

Testing is critical at every stage of migration. After each major step, validate functionality on your Ubuntu 22.04 ROS2 machine using the following methods:

- **Unit Tests**: Run or write unit tests for each migrated node/module.
- **Node-Level Testing**: Launch each node individually and verify its basic operation (e.g., topic publishing, service response).
- **Integration Testing**: Test communication between nodes as soon as two or more are migrated.
- **Simulation**: Use Gazebo or RViz2 to simulate robot/environment interactions before deploying to hardware.
- **Hardware-in-the-Loop**: When safe, test on the actual robot hardware.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Set up automated builds and tests to catch regressions early.

Refer to this section after each migration phase to ensure incremental validation and reduce debugging effort.

## 1. Audit and Categorize Existing ROS1 Code

- Identify all ROS1-specific code (e.g., `rospy`, `roslaunch`, `catkin`, message/service definitions).
- List all ROS1 packages used (e.g., in `anygrasp/`, `point_tracker/`).
- Classify code by function:
  - Perception (camera, vision, mask generation)
  - Planning (constraint, path, keypoint)
  - Control (robot SDK, xArm)
  - Communication (topics, services, actions)

**Testing:**
- Document current functionality and, if possible, create baseline tests for existing ROS1 nodes to compare with ROS2 versions later. See [Testing Along the Way](#testing-along-the-way).

---

## 2. Refactor Python Packages

- Ensure all Python code is Python 3 compatible.
- Refactor package structure to match ROS2 standards:
  - Each ROS2 package in its own directory with `setup.py` and `package.xml`.

**Testing:**
- After refactoring, run Python scripts (outside ROS) to ensure they work as expected in Python 3. See [Testing Along the Way](#testing-along-the-way).

---

## 3. Port ROS1 Nodes to ROS2

- Replace ROS1 APIs:
  - Change `import rospy` to `import rclpy`.
  - Update node initialization, publishers, subscribers, services, and parameters to ROS2 equivalents.
  - Replace `roslaunch` with ROS2 launch files (`.py` launch scripts).
- Update message/service definitions:
  - Convert custom `.msg` and `.srv` files to ROS2 format.
  - Place them in a `msg/` or `srv/` directory within each package.
- Update communication patterns:
  - Use ROS2 actions for long-running tasks.
  - Use ROS2 parameters and lifecycle nodes for configuration and state management.

**Testing:**
- After porting each node, launch it in ROS2 and verify its basic operation (see [Testing Along the Way](#testing-along-the-way)).
- Use ROS2 CLI tools (`ros2 topic echo`, `ros2 service call`, etc.) to check node communication.

---

## 4. Update Build System

- Switch to `colcon` build system.
- Update `CMakeLists.txt` and `package.xml` for ROS2 compatibility.

**Testing:**
- Build the workspace with `colcon build` after each major change.
- Fix build errors immediately and run any available tests. See [Testing Along the Way](#testing-along-the-way).

---

## 5. Update Launch and Config Files

- Convert `.launch` XML files to Python-based ROS2 launch scripts.
- Move YAML/JSON config files as needed and update paths.

**Testing:**
- Launch nodes using new ROS2 launch files and verify correct parameter loading and node startup. See [Testing Along the Way](#testing-along-the-way).

---

## 6. Test and Validate

- Write/port unit tests for each node and module.
- Test communication between nodes, perception, planning, and control.
- Use Gazebo or RViz2 for simulation and visualization.

**Testing:**
- Run all tests and simulations on Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS2.
- Compare results with baseline ROS1 functionality. See [Testing Along the Way](#testing-along-the-way).

---

## 7. Documentation

- Revise README and add migration notes.

**Testing:**
- Ensure documentation matches the current state of the code and migration process.

---

## 8. Optional: Leverage ROS2 Features

- Use lifecycle nodes for better node state management.
- Use DDS security for secure communication.
- Use composability for running multiple nodes in a single process.

**Testing:**
- Test new ROS2 features incrementally and document their impact on the workflow. See [Testing Along the Way](#testing-along-the-way).

---

## 9. Deployment

- Deploy on target hardware with Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS2.
- Monitor performance and fix any runtime issues.

**Testing:**
- Perform final end-to-end tests on hardware.
- Monitor for regressions and unexpected behavior. See [Testing Along the Way](#testing-along-the-way).

**Note:** Tackle migration one package/node at a time. Test each step before proceeding to the next.
